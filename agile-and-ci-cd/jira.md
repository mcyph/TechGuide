# Jira

Jira is a commercial piece of software written by Atlassian. It's one of the older and more commonly used pieces of software in bigger tech companies.&#x20;

It is quite customisable, allowing different teams to choose Kanban, Scrum or Kanplan (a hybrid of the two) depending on which is most appropriate for what they do.

Some of the better free alternatives are GitLab and Taiga.io.&#x20;

* GitLab also has a complete team issue management and tracking system, but it's worth noting GitLab can also work with many other tools like GitLab through its integration support.
* Taiga.io isn't as feature complete as Jira, but it is also worth a look for those new to agile processes as its interface is more streamlined.
