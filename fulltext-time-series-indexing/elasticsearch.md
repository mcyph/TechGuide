# Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a powerful fulltext search engine which is layered on top of the Java version of Lucene. Lucene provides a programming interface to implement in-process fulltext search in applications, whereas Elasticsearch provides a REST API.&#x20;

Elasticsearch is a complete ecosystem including Kibana for visualisations and Logstash for ingesting application logs into Elasticsearch indexes.
