# Micropython

Micropython is an implementation of python mainly intended for on ultra-low-power microcontrollers such as the raspberry pi pico or ESP32.&#x20;

It allows doing things such as dimming LEDs, reading from sensors or the state of buttons, or driving servo motors.

It often is used as an alternative to the Arduino IDE, or the Visual Studio Code IDE plugin Platform.IO's C/C++ environments.
